This is where i started my portfolio building when taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator hub

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from Ms Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolio building.


## Project topic E commerce sale Analysis

### Project overviwe

This Data Analysis aims to generate insight into the sales performace of the E commmerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from date.
